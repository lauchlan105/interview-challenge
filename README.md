# Usage Data Aggregator
Example solution for aggregating usage data from JSON data fetched from an API.
When giving this to a potential candidate, the idea is to only provide an empty index.ts file as well as the index.test.ts file which has an initial test to pass.
The candidate can solve the initial problem however they like, we are looking for their approach to the logic as well as project structure.

In the next steps, the candidate should build on the solution to aggregate the data by month/year and write tests for this enhancement.
This will see if their solution is scalable and can be easily adjusted for different time periods or requirements.

env file is found in 1pass

Challenge:
- Fetch usage data from API
- Pass the initial test: aggregate the usage data by a given day

Next
- Build on solution to aggregate data by month/year
- Write tests for this enhancement
